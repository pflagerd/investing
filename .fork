# Two fields separated by space.
# First field is the sha-1 of the "parent" repository at the time of the fork
# Second field is the sha-1 of this directory when it was forked from the parent repository
# These branches would have had the same contents in both repositories as at these two sha-1s.
# If branch names exist in the repositories, they may be used instead of sha-1s
# These fields must be url encoded so that they contain no spaces within each field
# There is a file in the parent called .forks which contains the same information, but in the opposite order.
